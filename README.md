# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This is a simple multiple logistic regression model trained to predict diabetes from a set of 8 features. 
The dataset used for training is The [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?resource=download) available on kaggle.
This was my first model and it isn't very accurate but I have built it from scratch without using sklearn or related libraries.
Other libraries used were Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
